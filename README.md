The second project I did. My participation in this project was partial: I made the core of the game, the architecture for creating and easily integrating new mini-games, menus, several animations, as well as a couple of mini-games themselves.

It's about a novice game developer who is constantly being pushed to do this by a bee teacher. 

There is a link to play the game in itch.io: <a href="https://night-coffee-studio.itch.io/game-design-for-beginners">https://night-coffee-studio.itch.io/game-design-for-beginners</a>

By the way, I acted as the reference and image of the main character of the game:
